# Scripts

***

This is a repo containing some scripts that I decided to upload. It is not an exhaustive list and it is **not** organized.

* collect_OHLC.py

    This is a script used to collect market data from Kraken's public endpoint

* gym.py

    This is the first script I wrote in python besides hello world. It's pretty bad and I didn't even know what dictionaries were at the time, maybe one day I'll make a better version. Maybe with a regression model to determine maxes and weights instead of whatever bs I did in this.
