# Scripts

***

This is a repo containing some scripts that I decided to upload. It is not an exhaustive list and it is **not** organized.

* collect_OHLC.py

    This is a script used to collect market data from Kraken's public endpoint

* gym.py

    This is the first script I wrote in python besides hello world. It's pretty bad and I didn't even know what dictionaries were at the time, maybe one day I'll make a better version. Maybe with a regression model to determine maxes and weights instead of whatever bs I did in this.

* fSARIMA-Nicola.r

    This is a script to practice manually and automatically assigning parameters to a SARIMA model using the partial autocorrelations (PACF) and autocorrelations (ACF). The naming convention fSARIMA stands for forecast (with) Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages.

* other-models.r

    This script applies other models (Linear, Ridge, Tree) to a built-in college dataset. It may or may not have been submitted as part of an exam and may or may not have received full credit.
